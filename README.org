* Introduction

* Features

* Details on the implementation

* Next steps

** KNOWCAUSE Cannot create Maps with ROBDDs 
   This is because the instance for order (in the case of the leafs) is not
   properly done and could use improvement. Not a major concern as I can simply
   use the labels which usually also derive order

** TODO: Start working on the implementation of distributed transition systems

* Things I am not totally happy about
